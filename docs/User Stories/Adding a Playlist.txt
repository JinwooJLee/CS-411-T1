After creating the playlist, it should be easy to add to a spotify account. The option to add would be easily seen. The user will be prompted to add their spotify account in order to add the playlist if they have not already done so. For more information on connecting a Spotify account, please refer to “OAuth.” If they do not enter a spotify account, then they will not be able to add a playlist. After choosing to add the playlist, the app will generate a default title to the playlist and set it to private. Then the app will add the playlist. If the user wants to change the title or privacy, they can do so on spotify. That way they can re-listen to the playlist if they want to, or embellish it by adding their own songs to the playlist. They could also choose to make a new playlist at any time.
