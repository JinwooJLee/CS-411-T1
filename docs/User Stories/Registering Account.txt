If the user already has an account, refer to “Logging In.” When arriving at the application, the user will be greeted with the home screen. At the very top of the website, there will be a button that will allow the user to register an account. The application will then prompt the user to enter some very basic information. This includes their email, a password and confirmation of it, the user’s main location/city, and a request to connect to the user’s Spotify account. For more information, please refer to the OAuth user story. The password will require some basic constraints for security purposes. This will include at least one capital and lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. If the password does not meet these requirements, then the user will be alerted that the password does not meet the specification and the account will not be created in that instance. After entering all the required information, the application will then create an account for the user. In the situation where the user has already created an account with a specific email, they will be notified of the error and prompted to log in instead. Otherwise, the application will save the user’s information in the database.
