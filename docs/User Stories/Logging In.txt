If a user does not have an account yet, please refer to “Registering Account.” As a current user, the log in function will be displayed at the home screen. There will be a button that allows the user to log in at the top of the website next to the registration button. The app will then ask the user for their email and password. After inputting the information and entering, the user will be able to access the app. There will also be an option to log into their spotify account. If they input their information incorrectly, they will be notified that their email and password combination was incorrect. 
In the situation that the user has forgotten their password, please refer to “Forgot Password.”
