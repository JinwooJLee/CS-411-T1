As a user, we want to be able to get the current weather and generate a spotify playlist based on it. The app should use their current location, but the user should be prompted to input a location if they would prefer that method instead. The user should be able to select a location from a list of saved locations they have previously entered or instantaneously create a playlist without having location data turned on or having to input a previously used location again. Based on the weather at the location the user has specified, the app should create a playlist with songs that are available on spotify based on the user’s desired number of songs in a playlist. If the user doesn’t like the first playlist outputted by the app, the user can have the app try again and make another playlist based off of the same location that was previously locked in and repeat this process until the app outputs a playlist that the user likes. Once the app outputs a good playlist for the user, the user should then be able to decide whether or not to keep the playlist and save it to their spotify account. For more information about adding a generated playlist to a spotify account, refer to “Adding a Playlist”

The weather should automatically be displayed for their location (either by location settings or by having an account and saving it).
