In the case that the user has forgotten their password, it is likely an issue with their Spotify account, not on our side. The user is likely logged in permanently on their phone/computer and does not remember their password. 
The app will not prompt the user to change their Spotify password, the user will have to change it themselves. Our application does not want to be responsible for storing or creating any passwords. The user will be prompted to change their password in the OAuth step, not on our own app. 
If the user does not change their password and redirects themselves back to the original page, there should be some sort of error message letting the user know the error is with them, prompting them to retry and reset their password in Spotify when reloading the app.
