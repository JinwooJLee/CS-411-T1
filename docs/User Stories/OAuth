As a logged in user, I want to be able to add my Spotify account in order to save generated playlists. This feature requires an account and if the user does not have one, see the “Register for an account” user story and to log in, refer to “Logging in” user story. A user who tries to save a playlist that does not have a spotify account connected should be prompted to log into their Spotify account, and a Spotify account should also be able to be added in the user’s settings. The user should then be able to be prompted to log into Spotify. A user’s Spotify account should only have to be logged into once and should be saved to that user’s account, but can be logged out of and replaced with a different Spotify account.
